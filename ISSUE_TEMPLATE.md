> Issues on Github are (mostly) meant for bug reporting and feature requests. For basic questions, please use our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API) instead.

> For bug reports, please include the debug log without any private information (login, etc.) by [enabling communications logging](https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API#ts3config-settings) and ensuring that ``DEBUG`` messages are being logged (enabled if you use the jar file, [see here if you use Maven](https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API#download)).
